#Cyborg

I will use this folder to release some commands I have done on Cyborg client. If you don't know what "Cyborg" is, just ignore this folder or learn on <a href="http://shadow19.xyz/cyborg/">here</a>.

<h1>Informations</h1>

<p>I'm NOT the ower of the client "Decoy Cyborg", i'm only posting some commands that users can use on their side. <br />
I'm NOT helping if you need help. If you need help, just visit <a href="http://shadow19.xyz/cyborg/">Cyborg's website</a> <br /> <br />
All commands are in ruby and some of them may be badly coded so don't blame me but my fingers! </p>

<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>If you are a good boy, you are mainly forced to give credits to people, so here we go:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Majora - Founder of the client</li>
    <li>SlOom (myself) - For the commands</li>
</li>
